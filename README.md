# Software Development Plan
- Describe at a high level what the application will do
- identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
- identify the target audience
- explain how a member of the target audience will use it

# List of features
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

They need

- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling

# Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include: 
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user

# Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.

# Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan

> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.

# Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.
You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements
